## A simple webserver in Python

------

### Requirements

Tested on Python 2.7.x
Python Setuptools and PIP installed

------

### Setup before initially running server

Before you run the server you must install the Flask module. Flask is the Python framework used in this example web server.

To install Flask run the following command in your Terminal console.

	pip install flask

This will download Flask and all of its requirements (Werkzeug & Jinja2)

------

### Running the server

Download the code. To keep your code organized it helps to put example files in their own directory, creating a directory in ~/Documents called 'itp-dwd-examples' is helpful.

Navigate to the directory via Terminal

	cd ~/Documents/itp-dwd-examples

Run the server with the command

	python web.py

If successful, a simple web server is now running on your computer at (http://localhost:5000)
